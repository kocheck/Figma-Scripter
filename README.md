# Figma-Scripter
Collection of scripts borrowed or written to be used the the Figma plugin Scripter. I needed a place to back these up for my personal use.

Install the [Scripter Plugin][ScripterLink]

# Getting Started
1. Make sure to read through the Scripter-docs.ts file to understand what is and isnt availible when planning out your script.
2. Make a fresh file with a descriptive name in the Dev file


# Organization & Attribution

## App
These are stable scripts found online and have been stable enough for use. If I missed attribution for any code in this repo please let me know or feel free to submit a PR!

### Currently contains scripts written by
_Thanks for your hard work and giving to the community_

-  [Alex Lockwood][AlexLockwoodLink]


## Dev
These scripts are ones I am currently playing with and should not be trusted to work correctly.
